# GritoWeb — WordPress Standards & Workflow

Single **source of truth** so every dev starts WordPress projects the same way.
Stack: **Sage 11** theme (Vite, Acorn, Blade, Tailwind), **Lando** local env,
standard WordPress layout (theme in `wp-content/themes/`, no Bedrock).

This repo is **documentation + reference**, not automation. You bring the
project up by hand (it's interactive anyway — Pantheon token, DB, etc.) and
copy the standards in.

## What's here

## How to use it on a new project

After WordPress is up (see workflow below), tell Claude (or any AI assistant):

> *"Access this repo: `<URL of this repo>` and import the kit into this project."*

The AI should fetch the repo and place every file according to the manifest
below. No shell script needed — the manifest **is** the source of truth.

### Import manifest

| From (this repo) | To (your project) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | `./CLAUDE.md` | Must be at the project root — Claude auto-loads it from there |
| `skills/html-qa-smoketest/` | `./.claude/skills/html-qa-smoketest/` | Copy the whole folder |
| `skills/create-block/` | `./.claude/skills/create-block/` | Copy the whole folder |
| `_docs/examples.md` | `./_docs/examples.md` | Reference patterns the AI uses for grounding |
| `_docs/launch-list.md` | `./_docs/launch-list.md` | Pre-launch checklist for go-live |
| `gitignore.example` | `./.gitignore` | **Only if** the project has no `.gitignore` yet — never overwrite |
| `prettier.config.example.js` | `<theme>/prettier.config.js` | Theme root; then add the `prepare` + `lint-staged` keys and copy the hook installer — see "Code formatting" |
| `install-git-hooks.example.mjs` | `<theme>/scripts/install-git-hooks.mjs` | Pre-commit installer; wired via the theme's `prepare` script |

`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and any other file at the kit's root are about
the kit itself and are **not** imported into projects.

The `global-skills/` folder is **not** part of the per-project import — see
"Global skills" below.

### Global skills (user-level — recommend, don't auto-import)

> **AI assistant: act on this.** After importing the per-project files above,
> always inspect `global-skills/`. These are **user-level** skills meant to
> live in `~/.claude/skills/` and be shared across *every* project — they are
> **not** copied into the project's `.claude/skills/`.
>
> For each skill in `global-skills/`, **tell the user it's recommended** and
> **offer to install it**. Install **only if the user agrees** — never copy
> into `~/.claude/skills/` silently. If the user declines, skip it and move on.
>
> On install, convert the flat file to the layout Claude Code expects (one
> folder per skill, each containing a `SKILL.md`):
>
> ```bash
> # global-skills/commit-rules.md  →  ~/.claude/skills/commit-rules/SKILL.md
> mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/commit-rules
> cp global-skills/commit-rules.md ~/.claude/skills/commit-rules/SKILL.md
> ```
>
> If a skill of the same name already exists in `~/.claude/skills/`, **don't
> overwrite** — show the user the difference and ask first.

### Doing it manually (if you prefer)

If you'd rather copy by hand instead of asking the AI, from the project root:

```bash
KIT=/path/to/this/repo

cp "$KIT/CLAUDE.md" ./CLAUDE.md
mkdir -p .claude/skills _docs
cp -R "$KIT/skills/html-qa-smoketest" .claude/skills/
cp -R "$KIT/skills/create-block" .claude/skills/
cp "$KIT/_docs/examples.md"     ./_docs/examples.md
cp "$KIT/_docs/launch-list.md"  ./_docs/launch-list.md
# only if the project has no .gitignore yet:
cp "$KIT/gitignore.example" ./.gitignore
```

Then point the AI at `_docs/examples.md` and `CLAUDE.md` for context before
generating code.

Global skills are **not** part of this per-project copy — they go to your
user-level `~/.claude/skills/` once and are shared across every project
(see "Global skills" above):

```bash
# install once per machine, not per project:
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/commit-rules
cp "$KIT/global-skills/commit-rules.md" ~/.claude/skills/commit-rules/SKILL.md
```

## Code formatting (enforced for every dev)

Tailwind class order isn't done by hand — it's automated and enforced at the
repo level. `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss` sorts classes in non-Blade files
(CSS `@apply`, JS/JSX); for `.blade.php`, `@shufo/prettier-plugin-blade` does
the sorting via its `sortTailwindcssClasses` option (the tailwindcss plugin
can't wrap the Blade parser). A pre-commit hook runs `lint-staged` so nothing
unsorted lands in a commit.

This works in **any layout** — whether the theme is the git root (standalone
theme repo) or a subdirectory of a larger repo (Pantheon / full-site). We do
**not** use the `husky` package: a tiny `prepare` script installs a native git
hook at the actual git root and points `core.hooksPath` at it, resolving the
root at runtime. (Running `npx husky init` inside a theme subdirectory is the
common trap — husky resolves `core.hooksPath` relative to the git root, so the
hook silently never fires.)

Set up once per theme (host, not inside Lando):

```bash
cd wp-content/themes/sage

# 1. formatter + plugins + lint-staged (NO husky)
npm i -D prettier prettier-plugin-tailwindcss @shufo/prettier-plugin-blade lint-staged

# 2. copy the kit's Prettier config + the hook installer
cp "$KIT/prettier.config.example.js" ./prettier.config.js
mkdir -p scripts
cp "$KIT/install-git-hooks.example.mjs" ./scripts/install-git-hooks.mjs
```

Then add to the theme's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": { "prepare": "node ./scripts/install-git-hooks.mjs" },
  "lint-staged": { "*.{css,blade.php,js,jsx}": "prettier --write" }
}
```

Run `npm install` once to fire `prepare` and install the hook. Because it runs
on `prepare`, any dev who clones and runs `npm install` gets the hook
automatically — Pantheon clone or local `git init`, no per-machine step.
The generated `.githooks/` is auto-managed; add `/.githooks/` to the repo
`.gitignore` (it's regenerated on every install).

## Project start workflow

Two scenarios. The "copy the standards in" part is identical; only how
WordPress comes up differs. Both start from a **brand-new, empty** site.

### Prerequisites (host machine)

Composer and Node run on the **host**; Lando only serves WordPress.

- Docker + [Lando](https://lando.dev/)
- PHP 8.2+ and Composer (Sage 11 scaffold)
- Node + npm (theme asset build)
- Git
- Scenario A only: a Pantheon account and a personal **machine token**
  (Pantheon → Account → Machine Tokens).

### Scenario A — Pantheon

1. Create the site on Pantheon (empty, raw WordPress).
2. Create the project folder locally and `cd` into it.
3. `lando init --source pantheon` — paste the machine token (hidden), pick the site.
4. `lando start` then `lando pull` (DB + uploads; `lando start` clones code only).
5. Scaffold Sage into the theme dir:
   ```bash
   cd wp-content/themes
   composer create-project roots/sage sage
   cd sage && composer install        # boots Acorn
   ```
6. Activate the theme: `lando wp theme activate sage`.
7. Copy the standards in (see "How to use it" above) — the Pantheon clone is
   already a git repo: review and commit through the normal flow,
   **never push without the project owner's permission**.
8. Build theme assets (see "Theme assets").

### Scenario B — Local only (no Pantheon)

1. Create the project folder and `cd` into it.
2. `lando init --recipe wordpress` (choose "current working directory").
3. Adjust `.lando.yml` (e.g. `php: "8.3"`), then `lando start`.
4. `lando wp core download`, configure `wp-config.php` (host `database`,
   credentials per recipe), open the install URL, set language + admin user.
5. Scaffold Sage (same as Scenario A, step 5).
6. Activate: `lando wp theme activate sage`.
7. Copy the standards in. Optionally `git init` + an initial commit
   (local only — never push without permission).
8. Build theme assets.

### Theme assets (both scenarios)

Sage 11 uses **Vite**. Composer/Node on the host, WordPress in Lando.

```bash
cd wp-content/themes/sage
npm install
npm run dev      # development (HMR)   — or:
npm run build    # production build
```

> **Lando + Vite gotcha:** the Vite dev server runs on the host while the site
> is served from the Lando container, so HMR can fail to connect until the dev
> server origin is reachable from the browser. If HMR misbehaves, use
> `npm run build` and reload, or align the Vite dev server URL with the Lando
> app URL in the theme's Vite config. Record the working setting per project.

## Maintaining the standards

`CLAUDE.md`, the skill and the examples are versioned here — this repo, not the
old gists, is the source of truth. To change a standard: open a PR, add a
`CHANGELOG.md` entry. Point the old gists at this repo (or archive them).

## Troubleshooting

- **`composer create-project` fails** — PHP must be 8.2+ on the host
  (`php -v`); Sage 11 requires it.
- **Theme not activating** — Lando must be running; run
  `lando wp theme activate sage` after `lando start`.
- **HMR not connecting** — see the Lando + Vite gotcha; `npm run build` is the
  reliable fallback.
- **Reset a Lando env** — `lando destroy -y && lando start` (local data lost;
  re-`lando pull` on Pantheon).
